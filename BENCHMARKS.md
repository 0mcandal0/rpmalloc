# Benchmarks
Contained in a parallell repository is a benchmark utility that performs interleaved allocations (both aligned to 8 or 16 bytes, and unaligned) and deallocations (both in-thread and cross-thread) in multiple threads. It measures number of memory operations performed per CPU second, as well as memory overhead by comparing the virtual memory mapped with the number of bytes requested in allocation calls. The setup of number of thread, cross-thread deallocation rate and allocation size limits is configured by command line arguments.

Benchmarks are run with parameters `benchmark <num threads> <mode> <distribution> <cross-thread rate> <loop count> <block count> <op count> <min size> <max size>`. It runs the given number of threads allocating randomly or fixed sized blocks in `[<min size>, <max size>]` bytes range. The `<mode>` parameter controls if it is random or fixed size. If random size, the `<distribution>` parameter controls if sizes are evenly distributed, have a linear falloff rate with size or an exponential falloff rate with size. In each thread, `<loop count>` number of loops are performed, allocating up to `<block count>` blocks in each thread. Every loop iteration `<op count>` number of blocks are deallocated, scattered across the entire set of blocks, then another set of `<op count>` number of blocks are allocated, also scattered across the entire set of slots in the block array (also deallocating any previous block in that slot). Every `<cross-thread rate>` loop iteration an `<op count>` number of blocks are allocated and handed off to another thread for cross-thread deallocation (memory allocated in one thread is freed in another thread).

The benchmark also measures the maximum requested allocated size and the used virtual memory by the process to calculate a overhead percentage.

Below is a collection of benchmark results for various allocation sizes. The machines running the Windows 10 and Linux benchmarks have 8 cores (4 physical cores with HT) and 12GiB RAM. The macOS machine is a MacBook, 2 cores (1 physical with HT) and 8GiB RAM. (Windows and macOS results coming soon)

The benchmark configurations are to be interpreted as performing alloc/free pairs of 10% of the allocated blocks in each loop iteration (in each thread). Since the free and alloc operations are scattered the patterns of requested sizes and block addresses are random and does not follow any sequential order.

# Result analysis
rpmalloc is faster than all allocators, except lockfree-malloc in some cases. However, the latter suffers from massive erratic memory overhead as the number of threads increases. Allocators such as tcmalloc and jemalloc trail behind with about 15% in performance, and jemalloc also suffers from higher memory overhead. 

# Random size in [16, 1000] range
Parameters: `benchmark <num threads> 0 0 2 10000 50000 5000 16 1000`
Evenly distributed sizes in `[16, 1000]` range, 10000 loops with 50000 blocks per thread. Every iteration 5000 blocks (10%) are freed and allocated in a scattered pattern. Cross thread deallocations every other loop iteration.

Ignoring the lockfree-malloc memory overhead range and focusing on the allocators we can see they are pretty close in memory overhead factors, with most of the multihreaded cases hovering around the 20% overhead mark.
