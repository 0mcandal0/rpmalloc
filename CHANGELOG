Fix init/fini checks in malloc entry points for preloading into binaries that does malloc/free in init or fini sections

1.1

Add four cache presets (unlimited, performance priority, size priority and no cache)

Slight performance improvement by dependent class index lookup for merged size classes

Adaptive cache size per thread and per size class for improved memory efficiency, and release thread caches to global cache in fixed size batches

Merged caches for small/medium classes using 64KiB spans with 64KiB large blocks

Require thread initialization with rpmalloc_thread_initialize, add pthread hooks for automatic init/fini

Added rpmalloc_usable_size query entry point

Fix invalid old size in memory copy during realloc

Optional statistics and integer overflow guards

Optional asserts for easier debugging

Provide malloc entry point replacements and automatic init/fini hooks, and a LD_PRELOAD:able dynamic library build

Improve documentation and additional code comments
